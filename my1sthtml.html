 <p style="background-color: slateblue">The breed’s Japanese name is a bit of a mystery. The Shiba Inu name probably translates to “brushwood dog.” It's believed that the name is from their tendency to run through brush or thick grass while hunting; others think it is because the dog and plant share the same fiery red color. Another theory is that Shiba actually means “small” instead of “brushwood.”</p>  
 <p style="color: red;">These tenacious hunters were bred to go after boars, birds, and bears. They also have dense undercoats, which allow them to withstand cold temperatures—a particularly helpful trait for a <sup>hunting dog.</sup></p> 
 <p style="font-size: 75px;">The first Shiba arrived in the United States in<strong>1954,</strong>  but the first litter born in the country didn’t make its <mark> debut until 1979.</mark> The American Kennel Club finally officially recognized the breed in 1992. Today, it is the 46th most popular dog in America.</p>
 <p style="color: rgb(226, 19, 226);">Shiba Inus can be a little standoffish around <b>strangers,</b> but they are fiercely loyal to their families. There's no better example than Mari, a Shiba Inu who, after the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake, alternated between caring for her elderly owner, who was trapped in his home, and her newborn puppies. The man was eventually rescued by an airlift, but had to leave the dogs behind. Miraculously, they survived; when the man returned, he found the mother was gaunt, but her puppies were plump and healthy. The amazing story of canine selflessness was so touching that it was adapted into a movie called A Tale of <sub>Mari and Three Puppies.</sub></p>

 <p style="color: aqua;">Shibas unleash an almost human-like wail if they’re upset. Sources of stress include getting baths or having their nails cut. With cries like these, it’s easy to see why they are sometimes considered the drama-queens of the dog world.</p>
